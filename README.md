## GravityArt
GravityArt is a creative, interactive particle simulation that demonstrates the gravitational attraction between objects. The simulation is built using the Processing programming environment, which is an open-source graphical library and integrated development environment based on the Java language. This project features a swarm of particles that attract each other based on their masses and velocities. Users can interact with the swarm and modify various parameters to observe how the particles behave under different conditions.

# Features
- Interactive particle simulation demonstrating gravitational attraction between objects
- Configurable simulation parameters such as gravity, dampening, trail length, and opacity
- Visual representation of particle mass, velocity, and acceleration through color
- Support for toroidal boundaries that wrap around the edges of the screen
- Ability to draw lines between particles to create dynamic patterns
- Control panel for adjusting settings during runtime
- Optional brush tool to interact with particles using mouse input
 -Option to save frames as a movie
# How to Run
1. Download and install the Processing development environment from the [official website](https://processing.org/download/).
2. Open the gravity_art.pde file in Processing.
3. Press the Run button to start the simulation.
# Usage
- Left-click anywhere in the simulation window to add a new particle.
- Right-click and drag the mouse to interact with particles using the brush tool.
- Modify parameters using the control panel in the lower-left corner of the screen.
- Press the Clear button to remove all particles and reset the simulation.
C# ustomization
You can modify the default values for various parameters directly in the code. Some examples include:

- <b>DAMPENING:</b> Controls how much the gravitational force affects the particle velocities.
- <b>MAX_SIZE and MIN_SIZE:</b> Determines the range of possible particle masses.
- <b>COLUMNS and ROWS:</b> Sets the initial number of particles in a grid layout.
- <b>G:</b> Sets the initial value for gravity.
- <b>TRAIL_LENGTH:</b> Sets the length of the particle trails.
- <b>OPACITY:</b> Sets the opacity of the particles.
